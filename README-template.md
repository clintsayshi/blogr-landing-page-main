## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

The css background property can do amazing things, At first I had no idea how I was gonna do the hero section until I started palying around with the background-\* selectors.

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources

- [PX to REM Calculator](https://daniellamb.com/experiments/px-to-rem-calc/) - This helped me with converting px to rem. In the previous challenge I learned to try avoid using px since they are not responsive.
- [HTML srcset](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/05/responsive-images-done-right-guide-picture-srcset/) - This helped me understand srcset even though I didnt end up using it on this project.
